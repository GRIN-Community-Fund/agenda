## Mwixnet TESTING by community
Testing is required for MWIXnetâ€™s implementation of the Mimblewimble CoinSwap proposal in order to review, detect issues, and improve performance. That is a community effort, any participation help about instructing ,testing is needed & gladly welcomed. First of all we need test coins. Do we have testnet coins any to send to testers ? _ @Mattczt , @navie
@yeastplume suggested it would be good if we can test..

__future3000__ : I just thought there might have been an issue with test net

__phyro__ : does anyone know what was the problem with testing?

__cekickafa__ : you mean testnet or mwixnet testing ?

Testnet works

__phyro__ : mwixnet testing

__cekickafa__ : well, for me it is hard to understand from insturction page a bit. I dont know others. What needs to be done to run it.:)
i tried testnet now. it is working.

>__phyro__ : mwixnet testing

did you run it ?

__phyro__ : I remember playing a bit with it but never actually ran the thing

__anynomous__ : I did not get around to testing MWMixnet, only just got a test environment set up and only just got my first test coins.
Now I'm ready to test but I am very time constrained.
