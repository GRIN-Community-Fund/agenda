## 1) Meme Contest

__future3000__ : So, this meme contest. There's been a few submissions so far, I've noticed more grin content on twitter.  We probably need to do a better job of pushing this out/ and promoting in the newsletter.

👍 cekickafa, anonymous

imo CC could front up with more Grins


__cekickafa__ : Meme contest shared on social media, and it appears that there is  community participation. Also shared in previous newsletter. We can share it again  if needed.


__future3000__ : I'll do some posts on the grin_privacy account
If you want to make a note to mention the contest is the next couple of newsletters ( until the cut off date Feb 28)

👍 cekickafa, jdavies



__cekickafa__ : Ok, lets push it a little more, i agree.


__anonymous__ : I will be unavailable for next 20-30 minutes, in case @dtavarez gives his 👍, I am ok with paying out the bounty.
👋

👍 future3ooo

__future3000__ : Anyone have anything else to add re the meme contest before we move onto the Python wrapper bounty?


## 2) Python cffi secp256k1-zkp wrapper - bounty Update.

__dtavarez__ : 

>__anonymous__ : I will be unavailable for next 20-30 minutes, in case @dtavarez gives his 👍, I am ok with paying out the bounty.

the pip install secp256k1-zkp-mw command isn't working, and it would be nice if they add a github action to run the tests automatically on every push or commit at least; other than that I don't see why not to start with drafting the transaction :)
one can clone the repo and it works just well as expected
@nicolasflamel1 can you fix any of this or Marek?

__nicolasflamel1__ : I'm replying in the forum post with the workaround required to install the module using pip on Windows. I think Marek adding automatic testing with Travis CI. I'll double check with him.

__future3000__ : Forum post for reference: https://forum.grin.mw/t/locked-python-cffi-secp256k1-zkp-wrapper-bounty/10030


__dtavarez__ :

one can add that workaround to the README file too.

👍 nicolasflamel1

for me it is good to go! :D

__nicolasflamel1__ : Awesome!

__dtavarez__ : thanks @nicolasflamel1! I'm happy to having you contributing to Grin!

👍 future3ooo, jdavies


__future3000__ : So it sounds like all parties are happy with the bounty being completed. If CC members could please upvote this message to support paying @nicolasflamel1 the full amount and we'll get onto drafting the tx

👍 future3ooo, mably, MCMmike, anonymous, dtavarez, cekikcafa

Has anyone else got anything they would like to add?  

I see there's been some recent discussion here Re CoinSwap:  https://github.com/mimblewimble/mwixnet/pull/18

__cekickafa__ : I wonder where we are at phase 3.

__future3000__ : I’d like to see more discussion re CoinSwap across all channels, since it’s arguably are most exciting development in progress
But anyway, doesn’t look like there is much else to discuss today. I will remind CC members to vote on the bounty payment.  

Next meeting we could also review this again: https://forum.grin.mw/t/minimalism-in-spending-of-the-community-council/10228/21 

And discuss if CC should donate anymore Grins to the meme contest.

👍 defistaker, cekickafa, anonymous

__cekickafa__ : yes, let's start  2023 and change the holiday mood.

Gui, python, coinswap 🔥
And Grin++ CLI.

💯 nicolasflamel, future3ooo

__future3000__ : I hope everyone had some time off over the holiday period and is feeling refreshed 🍻

Don’t forgot to share memes/ the meme contest across all social channels. Especially Twitter.
