## 1) Meme Contest

__anonymous__ :Nice to be the winner for ones, even though many of my memes were not that creative

__cekickafa__ :  Well, ai will help:)

__anonymous__ : In general I think it is a nice approach to distribute prices a lot. This was the first time we had 4 winners, with only small differences i prices.
This stimulates more community members to be active than just a single grand price.
I think that is all I have to say on this topic.

üëç cekickafa, defistaker

Maybe lets do a short update of what is interesting and going on.
Interesting things I noticed:
1) New members playing with both rust
 and python implementation of Grin and making nice projects like:
https://forum.grin.mw/t/vanitygen-for-grin/10379/8
2) Good activity going on on grin-wallet, and especially grin-gui wallet, although nothing works at the moment, so not a good time to test
3) A new (beta) version being released for Grin++
https://forum.grin.mw/t/grin-1-2-8-beta-5-now-live/10378/4
4) Interesting discussion going on at the forum, for example if Grin transacted offline:

Also the meme contest, although containing many bad memes (from me mostlyüòõ), got a record number of responses, 100 postsüéâ
So although the meetings and the CC are quit, things keep moving on on their own ‚öôÔ∏è

## 2) Kucoin Exchange integration progress

__cekickafa__ : Are you in KUCOƒ∞N chatroom ?

__defistaker__ : Lots of thing to catch up if one is being away for a while. Grin is progressing surely.

__anonymous__ : No. KUCOIN did not want to implement the slatepack way right, and are now even bitching about possible delisting, is that correct?
That is just the rumours that reached me.

__cekickafa__ : i dont know about delisting. Where did you hear it ?

__anonymous__ : Not sure about delisting, but they were hesitant to about implementing the withdrawal, which is strange considering they got help and spend time on it.
you probably know more since you are in the chat

__cekickafa__ : They implemented withdrawal. I will mention in this newsletter today. You can withdraw via TOR.

__anonymous__ : Ok, cool. So good news.
I mean slatepack withdrawal would be even better, but torrents work for most, only pity for the chines community members who cannot transact via tor easily.

__cekickafa__ : But if there is some rumours, i dont know. It is unusual to implement withdrawal before deposit‚öíÔ∏è
They implemented without MEMO

__anonymous__ : Withdrawals lead to less tickets, deposits without the part behind the comma working as ID gives them lots of tickets. So that is probably why they first implement withdrawals.

__cekickafa__ : So rumours might be true, they might delist. If not they would implement MEMO. Just my tought. I dont have info.

__anonymous__ : Implementing slatepacks would avoid all those tickets.

üëç cekickafa

__cekickafa__ : yes, Tradeogre works fine.

__anonymous__ : I think they go for MEMO and possibly delist, or threaten with it in the hope to get more liquidity or money. We as completely open free community of course never provide payment for exchange services and listing, we only show community members the options out there.

üëç cekickafa

__cekickafa__ : If they want liquidity, open deposit and no problem. Gate buy, Kucoin sell :)
Liquidity is no problem

üëç anonymous

__anonymous__ : Good point. 
I have to go to the gym, a healthy mind, needs a healthy body üí™ üß†
So unless there is something we urgently need to discuss, I would like to close the (official) meeting for today.
