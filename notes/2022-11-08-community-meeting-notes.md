# Agenda Points & Actions

* Current meeting [agenda](https://github.com/grincc/agenda/issues/71)



First agenda point:



##  1) MW/Grin Workshop+Hackaton in Istanbul


__anonymous__ : Lets take 1 minute to review the agenda, if any more items need to be added let us know.


__dtavarez__ : I already introduced the topic and gave all details I have
In summary: there is a big chance of having a MW/Grin workshop+hackaton in Istanbul

__anonymous__ : The way I see it, we can only benefit from a hackaton. Not only for the actual output in code and exploration of topics, but also to introduce a wider group of capable crypto researchers to Grin and MW. They might become future developers.
I think it is best to offer a list of a few topics they can chose to work on based on their interest and background. Also they are free to make suggestions for topics of their own.

👍 cekickafa, dtavarez, defistaker

I would love for them to explore the implementation of Grin vauchers (slatepack like message with the mnemonic) that can be loaded to top up a wallet, as paper wallet or as w one-step (transaction actually happens before sending the voucher) transaction.
But again, it depends on whether they like to work on this topic.

__dtavarez__ : That’s sounds a good idea, maybe I could open a forum post to collect all the ideas there

💯anonymous

I wonder if we can suggest things that already have a bounty ?
I also like the idea of encouraging them to fix at least an issue from GitHub
Anyways I’ll collect the suggestions in a forum post
Let’s move the conversation to the forum so more people can give their opinions

👍 anonymous

Also I would like to read more opinions in regards to a budget limit for this
So the organizers could have a better idea and makes the necessary adjustments.

__anonymous__ : Same here. I am fine with bounties and awards, I am not sure if and how much we should cover other organizational costs. I think those should at least partly be for the university.

__dtavarez__ : I think the university will provide the space and the internet connection as far as I know. And the support needed to make it happen

##  2) Request for funding duty tax bill for testnet miner sent to @mattczt3


__dtavarez__ : is @mattczt3 around?

__mattczt3__ :  Hi I'm here.

__dtavarez__ : Is there any way you could share the proof of the paid bill with some of us in private? You can hide personal opinion of course
I guess we it was agreed you will have running a testnet miner running it is fair to reimburse that

__mattczt3__ : Yes of course, I will send to mike if that's okay ? Is I've already shared info with him.

__dtavarez__ : Could you send it to more than one person?

__mattczt3__ : I will also send to you.

👍 dtavarez

__anonymous__ : As long as there is proof, I have no objection to compensate, it only is reasonable I think.

__mattczt3__ : Thanks, I'm happy to donate my time for free of course.
I have a few issues with the wallet listener stopping, I will look into it.

__cekickafa__ : Side Note: also @-naive received a miner for testnet.

👍 anonymous

__mattczt3__ : So I will send the proof to date and mike as soon as I can.

👍 dtavarez

__dtavarez__ : 

>__mattczt3__ : I have a few issues with the wallet listener stopping, I will look into it.

I think @satoshocrat could help you with that maybe.

__mattczt3__ : Thanks i will ask.

__dtavarez__ : 

>__cekickafa__ : Side Note: also @-naive received a miner for testnet.

Did he receive it already?

__cekickafa__ : Yes, he dİd.

__dtavarez__ : Is his miner running?

__cekickafa__ : Not yet, but maybe running witihin days. Will ask him.

__dtavarez__ : How can we verify that?

__mattczt3__ : 

>__dtavarez__ : How can we verify that?

Block explorer is not working. But I can tell on my node if anyone else is mining. Dave I've sent screens to tg

__dtavarez__ : How are we gonna verify the miners will be running on testnet only? I’m asking but probably that question was already answered.

>__mattczt3__ : Block explorer is not working.

That’s correct, I need to fix that. I’ll do it this week.

__cekickafa__ : Thats cool.

__mattczt3__ : 

>__dtavarez__ : How are we gonna verify the miners will be running on testnet only? I’m asking but probably that question was already answered.

You can tell by the difficulty I suppose, not sure.

__dtavarez__ : Ok, let’s solve the Block Explorer for now.

👍 mattczt3, cekickafa

__cekickafa__ : I pinged naive, asked if he is running.

__mattczt3__ : Yeah I said I will run through the setup again and make notes, he might be waiting for that. I will be busy for at least another week though.

__dtavarez__ : Cool.There is a opened forum post for this topic, I think keeping the community posted would be good

__mattczt3__ : No, we talked about it on the funding request, I will make a new topic.

👍 dtavarez

__dtavarez__ : Better then. Well if there’s no more to comment, we could close this meeting. Thanks for your time.
