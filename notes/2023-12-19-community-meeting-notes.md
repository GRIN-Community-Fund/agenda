## Unconfirmed transactions


__waynegeorge__ : I’m just looking to see what the unconfirmed TXs is about. Is it unique to g++?

__cekickafa__ : Not i think. Sometimes you need to rebroadcast the transaction becuz of dandelion i think. I am not expert tough. I might be mistaken.
But clearly it is a problem for user.

__waynegeorge__ : Last time I was here there was a conversation about mwix testing. I haven’t caught up on forum but I’m wondering how it’s going?


__cekickafa__ : @scilio made an update, keybase://chat/grincoin#dev/24808

 

__waynegeorge__ : Amazing, thanks. Seems quiet here today, but a topic that I wanted to bring up at some point was regarding creating a team to do things such as testing and support. As I understand, currently Yeastplume is the only core developer and you are the groundskeeper. Other than that there is nobody else getting paid to work on the project. I wonder if this needs to change dramatically in order to grow grin


__ardocrat__ : yo

  I like this idea, will try to implement at node level if possible, wallet is easier, but affects usability :)

👍   cekickafa, waynegoerge

__cekickafa__ : Well, i am mostly doing the leg work and record keeping and some ecoystem monitoring stuff. Scilio is paid on bounty mwixnet only. I am not technical much but i constantly get feedback from users via dm, Tg channel etc. Testing and support team about specific something or?

__ardocrat__ :

nope, same bug was noticed at Beam as well, Dandelion related possibly


__cekickafa__ : Beam as well ? i didnt know this. Then this is not related to grin++ only

💯 ardocrat, anonymous

__ardocrat__ :  Yeah, saw reports at their support chat

__cekickafa__ : Auto rebroadcast implemented on core wallet or?

__ardocrat__ : not implemented.just an idea. to autobroadcast you need to keep wallet open. node level is just better for usability

👍 cekickafa

 I’m thinking managing nodes, building some test scripts. Basically just getting their hands dirty and reporting issues in a clear, structured way

👍 cekickafa


__cekickafa__ : @tromp @yeastplume @phyro @dtavarez can comment on this

__waynegeorge__ : I’d love to do more but with a 9-5 and side project, there’s no “free” time

__ardocrat__ : same here, I am finishing side project before new year to come back to grin :)
time is moving really fast, the most precious resource

__cekickafa__ : Well, happy new year to you all by the way. Last meeting of 2023.
