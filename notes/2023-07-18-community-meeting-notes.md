## Proposed Agenda

- Suggestion for procedural changes related to CC payments.

        For BTC txs:
        Community support > CC Payment approved by alteast 4/6 in public CC chat > PR submitted > tx drafted> CC signing the tx > PR merged.

        For Grin txs:

        Community support > CC Payment approved by alteast 4/6 in public CC chat > PR submitted > PR merged by the CC member who made the payment.
        **Since the grin wallet is not multi sig it's harder to keep track of, so the person making the payment needs to be the one who seeks approval to merge.

- Discussion: Bounty for new GPU solver with better efficancy than a G1 mini.



__cekickafa__ : Due to lack of participation, today community meeting is postponed. FYI.☀️

__future3000__ : For reference, Anon is away camping, Mike is traveling, not sure about mwgrin_fr. 

I'm around, but it's 3am NZ time, so I'll be sleeping.

There's quite alot to discuss, so rather than skip a meeting we might look to move it to next week.




## To Do List.

- Getting wallet information and wallet Trxs output from @hendi.
- Discuss and create predefined process ( that gets documented in the CC repo) for electing/ appointing new CC members moving forward.
